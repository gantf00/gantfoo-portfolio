I would’ve sworn you two had met before, the way you both chirped on and on like old drinking buddies. You bobbed your head; the bird bobbed back. You made a squawk; the bird squawked back. All of a sudden, I realized: you are a bird, and you’ve always been a bird. You two are animal siblings.</p><p>Ten years ago, our stupid cockatiel, Polly, executed a perfect nosedive into a pan full of room-temp canola oil (the one you’d fried up chips with the night before). You buffed her soggy wings with soap for a week, even when she pierced your hands bloody with her scared little bird bites.</p><p>A year later, we woke up and she was dead. You and I shared a bunk bed back then, and I remember how you didn’t talk for three days, to me or anyone. You just bobbed your head—left-to-right and up-and-down. Nervous. Scanning. I tiptoed so you wouldn’t fly away. The only sound we shared was the creaky bedframe in our basement bedroom.</p><p>But I get it now. You are a bird, and mourning is hard in a second language. Maybe if I’d had a bird brain then, I could’ve squawked:</p><p>“[bok. bok.]<br>I’m not a bird,<br>I know, but</p><p>I’ll nip your hand<br>and bob my head<br>if you’d like.</p><p>You can play me<br>your saddest songs,<br>your Radiohead shit</p><p>I never loved,<br>and I’ll nod along<br>with you—</p><p>because<br>you are my<br>bird brother,<br>and I want<br>to talk<br>[bok. bok.]<br>to you.”</p></div></main><footer><p>grant frazier</p></footer><script async="" defer="" src="/assets/main.js"></script></body></html>
