<h1>Twitter DM Death Threat I Sent to Jesus Christ Last Night</h1>

*Published to [MaudlinHouse.net](https://maudlinhouse.net/twitter-dm-death-threat-i-sent-to-jesus-christ-last-night/) on Apr. 5 2025*

**YOU** prince of cold, of peace, of stones and lobbing long-thrown
venom writhing wriggling: I am rumbling raging brush and
you are my animal sibling grunting & growling, howling flesh
pillaging boiling sores & munching on wishbones mourning;
you whip buttercream frosting bloodied by red 40 into a vortex,
swirling batter to beaten death like the loaded gun in ur jeans –
what does a gun believe, but romance and ratchety heightening –
you sickening sky beast circling sugar high desert, you
exorcist convulsing, you polluted smokestack bellowing
rolled coal thru cherrybomb mojave halogen, plume-buh-booming
sun tints gutty-red from your cake-splatting particulate shade,
you holy ghost’s ciggy-butt-charred frame, you are a locket of
[BANG! BANG!] iron bullets ricocheting ur gnarly breast pocket,
you are cannibal teeth gnawing my petrochemical kitchen sink,
you are black tar fuming up up up and spewing the color of red-
robe cardinals locking down rome so they can burn the pope and
transubstantiate his holy Holy Holy into soot for all the birds to *choke*!!!
