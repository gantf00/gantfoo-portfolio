## **Twitter DM Death Threat I Sent to Jesus Christ Last Night** 
(Originally published on maudlinhouse.net) 
<div class="poem-content">
  
YOU prince of cold, of peace, of stones and lobbing long-thrown   
venom writhing wriggling: I am rumbling raging brush and   
you are my animal sibling grunting & growling, howling flesh  
pillaging boiling sores & munching on wishbones mourning;   
you whip buttercream frosting bloodied by red 40 into a vortex,  
swirling batter to beaten death like the loaded gun in ur jeans –  
what *does* a gun believe, but romance and ratchety heightening –   
you sickening sky beast circling sugar high desert, you  
exorcist convulsing, you polluted smokestack bellowing   
rolled coal thru cherrybomb mojave halogen, plume-buh-booming  
sun tints gutty-red from your cake-splatting particulate shade,   
you holy ghost’s ciggy-butt-charred frame, you are a locket of  
\[*BANG\! BANG\!*\] iron bullets ricocheting ur gnarly breast pocket,  
you are cannibal teeth gnawing my petrochemical kitchen sink,  
you are black tar fuming up up up and spewing the color of red-  
robe cardinals locking down rome so they can burn the pope and  
transubstantiate his holy Holy Holy into soot for all the birds to *choke\!\!\!*
