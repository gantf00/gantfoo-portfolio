<h1>Pareto's Law</h1>

I am wearing an olive green apron and   
Shout greetings at arriving friends,  
Chill radiating off their slunken coats  
They wore to trek to mine for dinner. 

Thermodynamics, I think, means the freeze  
On their jackets mingles with steam,  
Pulling out the cold, like reservoirs melting,  
Releasing to craft our cozy, lazy equilibrium. 

I stir a big, fragrant pot of curry,   
Someone brought a cider that looks   
Pretty and couldn’t cost more than five dollars.   
I stop and hold it in my hands. I made a flan

And I let everyone know. The   
Basmati rice tastes sort of like Christmas,  
The spices and the cider hit my stomach,  
Make my cheeks red like streaks of fire

On a meteor blistering in earth’s orbit   
To end the Cretaceous period.   
I give thanks to the dinosaurs who  
Gave their bones to make this home for me. 

I flop the flan on a wooden tray, and lay   
Down a pile of spoons. We eat it together —  
Too eggy for some, but one couple loved it.   
Pareto’s law tells me that 80% of the flan will be 

Eaten by 20% of the dinner guests. They all leave   
Eventually and I start the dishwasher. I fall   
Asleep to the slushing, rhythmic roar of   
Hot water cleaning gunk off of cutlery. 

Sometime, the heat death of the universe will  
Come for everyone still around,  
When a big bang’s heat spreads thin and   
Sputters, wheezes under its own weight. 

Weight like unkempt Appalachian bonfires,  
Whooshing, crackling mass transmuted to ash;  
Like electric ovens conjure flan from custard batter,  
Like pterodactyls, earth’s greenhouse, long warm, long life,

Blips of hot; quarks made from nothing,  
*Ex Nihilo* buzzing, without shape. Connection so   
Transient, flitting in and out of ether, intangible,   
and it all cools down eventually. It all just goes so quick.
