<h1>my name is grant. hi!</h1>

I'm an emerging poet based out of chicago (aka the greatest city in the world). In 2022 I wrote some stuff about trains and urban planning, too!  

Back in the day, I co-founded **[The Prodigal Press](instagram.com/prodigalpressprovo)**, a provo, UT-based journalism/literary collective. I'm no longer involved with the group, but the current team is making stunning, beautiful content and you should go check it out. 

My writing has been published in various magazines and publications including *FRiGG Mag* (forthcoming), *Veilance Press* (forthcoming), *WREATH Mag*, *Maudlin House*, *The Salt Lake Tribune*, *Prodigal Press* (don't call me a nepo baby), *The Urbanist*, and more.
