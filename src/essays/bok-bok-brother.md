## **Bok-bok Brother** 
*Originally published in [Fork Apple Press's Core Review #2](https://forkapplepress.com/the-core-review/issue-2/bok-bok-brother).*

At the Cuenca aviary, a macaw landed on your shoulder—you didn’t even flinch. I would’ve sworn you two had met before, the way you both chirped on and on like old drinking buddies. You bobbed your head; the bird bobbed back. You made a squawk; the bird squawked back. All of a sudden, I realized: you are a bird, and you’ve always been a bird. You two are animal siblings.

Ten years ago, our stupid cockatiel, Polly, executed a perfect nosedive into a pan full of room-temp canola oil (the one you’d fried up chips with the night before). You buffed her soggy wings with soap for a week, even when she pierced your hands bloody with her scared little bird bites.

A year later, we woke up and she was dead. You and I shared a bunk bed back then, and I remember how you didn’t talk for three days, to me or anyone. You just bobbed your head—left-to-right and up-and-down. Nervous. Scanning. I tiptoed so you wouldn’t fly away. The only sound we shared was the creaky bedframe in our basement bedroom.

But I get it now. You are a bird, and mourning is hard in a second language. Maybe if I’d had a bird brain then, I could’ve squawked:

“[bok. bok.] 
I’m not a bird, 
I know, but 

I’ll nip your hand 
and bob my head 
if you’d like. 

You can play me 
your saddest songs, 
your Radiohead shit 

I never loved, 
and I’ll nod along 
with you—

because 
you are my 
bird brother, 
and I want 
to talk 
[bok. bok.] 
to you.”
