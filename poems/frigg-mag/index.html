I made a flan</p><p>And I let everyone know. The<br>Basmati rice tastes sort of like Christmas,<br>The spices and the cider hit my stomach,<br>Make my cheeks red like streaks of fire</p><p>On a meteor blistering in earth’s orbit<br>To end the Cretaceous period.<br>I give thanks to the dinosaurs who<br>Gave their bones to make this home for me.</p><p>I flop the flan on a wooden tray, and lay<br>Down a pile of spoons. We eat it together —<br>Too eggy for some, but one couple loved it.<br>Pareto’s law tells me that 80% of the flan will be</p><p>Eaten by 20% of the dinner guests. They all leave<br>Eventually and I start the dishwasher. I fall<br>Asleep to the slushing, rhythmic roar of<br>Hot water cleaning gunk off of cutlery.</p><p>Sometime, the heat death of the universe will<br>Come for everyone still around,<br>When a big bang’s heat spreads thin and<br>Sputters, wheezes under its own weight.</p><p>Weight like unkempt Appalachian bonfires,<br>Whooshing, crackling mass transmuted to ash;<br>Like electric ovens conjure flan from custard batter,<br>Like pterodactyls, earth’s greenhouse, long warm, long life,</p><p>Blips of hot; quarks made from nothing,<br><em>Ex Nihilo</em> buzzing, without shape. Connection so<br>Transient, flitting in and out of ether, intangible,<br>and it all cools down eventually. It all just goes so quick.</p></div></main><footer><p>grant frazier</p></footer><script async="" defer="" src="/assets/main.js"></script></body></html>
